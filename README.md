# Mini-hoop-score-counter
using a ultrasonic sensor lcd display and ATMEGA32 to count every time an object is less then 4cm infront of the sensor.

If you want to implement this into a actual basketball mini-hoop then place the ultrasonic sensor right at the rim and vary the 'if (distance < 4.0)' code based on the distance from the ultrasonic sensor and the other side of the rim in the hoop. Take this a step further with a Bluetooth module.
